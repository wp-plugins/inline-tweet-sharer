== Description ==

Inline Tweet Sharer is a plugin that allows you to easily and simply create links to share your content on twitter. These links share whatever the anchor text is (as well as a prefix or suffix if context is needed), so it is designed to share tweetable content (like stats, quotes, titbits or competition entries) easily and quickly on twitter, hopefully encouraging people to click on said links, increasing traffic to your blog.

Links can either be highlighted as Twitter links or look the same as regular links, and there is a Rich Text Editor button you can use to click and easily add the links.

You can see an example on the [Inline Tweet Sharer Plugin page](http://winwar.co.uk/plugins/inline-tweet-sharer/).

Styles are already provided, but if you wish we can help you design the plugin to fit your site with our [CSS Customisation Service](http://winwar.co.uk/plugins/inline-tweet-sharer/#csscustomisation)
